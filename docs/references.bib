abstract = {The massive collection of data via emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) requires finding optimal ways to reduce the created features that have a potential impact on the information that can be extracted through the machine learning process. The mining of knowledge related to a concept is done on the basis of the features of data. The process of finding the best combination of features is called feature selection. In this paper we deal with multivariate time-dependent series of data points for energy forecasting in smart buildings. We propose a methodology to transform the time-dependent database into a structure that standard machine learning algorithms can process, and then, apply different types of feature selection methods for regression tasks. We used Weka for the tasks of database transformation, feature selection, regression, statistical test and forecasting. The proposed methodology improves MAE by 59.97% and RMSE by 40.75%, evaluated on training data, and it improves MAE by 42.28% and RMSE by 36.62%, evaluated on test data, on average for 1-step-ahead, 2-step-ahead and 3-step-ahead when compared to not applying any feature selection methodology.}

abstract = {This paper deals with supervised classification of multivariate time series. In particular, the goal is to propose a filter method to select a subset of time series. Consequently, we adopt the framework proposed by Brown al. [1]. The key point in this framework is the computation of the mutual information between the features, which allows us to measure the relevance of each feature subset. In our case, where the features are a time series, we use an adaptation of existing nonparametric mutual information estimators based on the k-nearest neighbor. Specifically, for the purpose of bringing these methods to the time series scenario, we rely on the use of dynamic time warping dissimilarity. Our experimental results show that our method is able to strongly reduce the number of time series while keeping or increasing the classification accuracy.}

journal = {IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering},
abstract = {This paper proposes an attention-based LSTM (AT-LSTM) model for financial time series prediction. We divide the prediction process into two stages. For the first stage, we apply an attention model to assign different weights to the input features of the financial time series at each time step. In the second stage, the attention feature is utilized to effectively select the relevant feature sequences as input to the LSTM neural network for the prediction in the next time frame. Our proposed framework not only solves the long-term dependence problem of time series prediction effectively, but also improves the interpretability of the time series prediction methods based on the neural network. In the end of this paper, we conducted experiments on financial time series prediction task with three real-world data sets. The experimental results show that our framework for time series pre-diction is state-of-the-art against the baselines.}
